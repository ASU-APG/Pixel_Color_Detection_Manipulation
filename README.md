# Pixel_Color_Detection_Manupulation
The scripted in IPython Notebook provided a OpenCV2 based color detection and manupulation codes.

Say we would like to replace all WHITE pixels in the image to RED:
<p float="center">
  <img src="/test.jpg" width="400" />
  <img src="/test2.png" width="400" /> 
</p>

### Color Detection:
We are using the Euclidean Distance to select the most similar color from a pre-given color dictionary based on their RGB values.
